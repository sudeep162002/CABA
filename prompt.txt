Please use the following instructions to create a JSON object representing a travel trip from the data in the provided PDF text.

The JSON object should have the following structure:
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "inward_from": "",
  "inward_to": "",
  "outward_from": "",
  "outward_to": "",
  "visits": 1,
  "vendor": "",
  "inward_charges": "",
  "outward_charges": ""
}

Instructions:

- Analyze the text for a single trip record.
- If the trip time is before 1 PM (12-hour clock), fill only the "inward" fields ("inward_from", "inward_to", "inward_charges") and set all "outward" fields ("outward_from", "outward_to", "outward_charges") to an empty string "".
- If the trip time is 3 PM or later, fill only the "outward" fields and leave the "inward" fields as empty strings "".
- If any field's information is missing or cannot be determined from the text, set that field to an empty string "".
- The "visits" field should default to 1 if no other information is available.
- Ensure the output is a single, valid JSON object. Do not output anything other than the JSON.

Example Entry (for a trip before 1 PM):
{
  "date": "2025-06-01",
